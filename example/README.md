# Examples

Each directory you see here contains a standalone, working example project that demonstrates Pogo's features and APIs.

To run an example quickly, use `deno -A https://deno.land/x/pogo/example/<name>/run.ts`, where `<name>` is the name of the example. See the `README.md` of each project for further details and instructions on running the example locally so that you can play around with it.

**Tip:** For security reasons, Deno requires you to explicitly grant permission for a server to listen for requests, hence the usage of `-A`. You can use `--allow-net` or other flags instead to grant fewer permissions, if you prefer, though it may affect the functionality of the examples.
